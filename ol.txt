My goal is to be able to groom others to rise and fulfill their God-given assignment and to help others discover their potential.
The growth and progress of the lives of those I lead is what I believe motivates me to keep doing what I do.
I try as much as possible to place myself in their shoes to understand their point of view and then derive a vision that they can believe in to pursue. I try to dissect the vision to be achievable.

Over the years, I've learned to work on myself to know where my strengths are and what are beyond me. This is done through learning and learning. I have consciously placed barriers to prevent me from tipping off track, e.g., What I do, where I go, who I walk with, etc. For me, leading people is for their betterment, so as much as possible, decisions must be taken mostly in their interest. Being others-oriented puts you ahead of the rest.
